# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classifier

## Introduction

This project builds a neural network to evaluate the MNIST dataset, a benchmark for handwritten digit recognition. The MNIST dataset is commonly used for training various image processing systems and is a great dataset for sanity checking models. Benchmark results on MNIST include:

- 88% - Lecun et al., 1998
- 95.3% - Lecun et al., 1998
- 99.65% - Ciresan et al., 2011

High accuracy levels can be achieved by both large convolutional neural networks and small linear models, making familiarity with the dataset essential.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `MNIST_Handwritten_Digits-STARTER.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the project code.
- `MNIST_Handwritten_Digits-STARTER.html`: HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook for easy viewing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
